Use of ViennaRNA package and functions in Python for the conversion of RNA sequences in dot-bracket format to other notations.

This code was done in Python using the shell. For some reason it doesn't download properly in other formats. So you can check how to install the package from here: https://github.com/ViennaRNA/ViennaRNA
If it gives you issues when trying to import RNA, I did this and it worked perfectly after that:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ (of course in here you must change python3.10 to whatever version of python you have).
